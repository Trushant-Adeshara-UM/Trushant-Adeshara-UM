Botlab is the second part of ROB 550: Robotics System Lab wherein my primary task was to develop software stack for 2-wheel differential drive robot from ground-up using Lightweight Communications and Marshalling (LCM) Library alongside C++.

Action:
- Cascade Control and PID
- 3-DoF rigid-body coordinate transforms
- Planner kinematics of differential-drive ground robot
- Motio models with uncertainity

Perception:
- Quadrature Encoders
- MEMS Inertial Measurement Unit
- 2D LiDAR Ragefinders
- Camera and Fiducial Maker Detection

Reasoning
- Monte Carlo Localization
- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
- A* Search
- Path Planning
