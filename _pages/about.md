Welcome! I'm <b>Trushant Adeshara</b>, a passionate <b>Robotics Researcher</b> and current M.S. student in <a href="https://robotics.umich.edu/profile/trushant-adeshara/">Robotics at the University of Michigan</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
My current research focuses on <b>multi-robot systems, parallel computing, hardware acceleration,</b> and, <b>additive manufacturing</b>. In <b>Professor Dimitra Panagou's</b> <a href="https://dasc-lab.github.io/">Distributed Aerospace Systems and Control (DASC) Lab</a>, I am developing simulation stack for heterogeneous exploration with <b>Isaac Sim</b>, integrating <b>Isaac ROS Nvblox</b> for voxel-based mapping and path planning. Recently, I started incorporating <b>certifiability guarantees into visual odometry and mapping</b> to ensure safe and reliable trajectory generation in dynamic environments, bridging simulations with real-world applications.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
At <a href="https://www.wastefullinsights.com/">Wastefull Insights</a>, I <b>developed system and software architecture</b> for gantry-based pick-and-place waste segregation robots. I integrated <b>YOLOv7</b> and <b>DeepStream</b> into a ROS-based system, doubling throughput with improved scheduling algorithms and built a CI/CD pipeline that <b>reduced deployment times by over 70%</b>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
During my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering, I interned at <a href="https://www.botsync.co/">Botsync</a>, where I conducted <b>accuracy tests on mobile robots for docking</b> and migrated code from Python to C++. I also worked on <b>multi-robot behavioral graph in Open-RMF</b>, enabling collision-free task execution for mobile robots.</p>
