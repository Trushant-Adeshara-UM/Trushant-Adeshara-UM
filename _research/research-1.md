In the ROB 550 Robotic Systems Lab's Arm module, I honed my skills in working with a 5-DOF robotic arm, building a comprehensive system around it. Here's a snapshot of my learnings:

**Acting:**
- Forward kinematics modeling of a manipulator
- Inverse kinematics modeling of a manipulator
- Grasping techniques
- 5-DOF rigid-body coordinate transform using homogeneous coordinate transforms

**Sensing:**
- 3D image calibration
- Object detection using OpenCV
- Implementation with depth camera sensors

**Reasoning:**
- Path planning and optimization
- Designing state machines for efficient operation
