Wastefull Insights, a cutting-edge deep tech startup headquartered in Vadodara, is dedicated to pioneering AI-driven solutions for effective waste segregation. The company goes beyond traditional approaches by introducing "Achhe Dinn," India's first e-commerce platform promoting recycled, upcycled, and sustainable products. Wastefull Insights focuses on driving source segregation, circular economy practices, and automating dry waste segregation across the nation. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I embarked on my journey with Wastefull Insights as a robotics engineering intern, tasked with studying the existing code base. My primary goal was to develop a scheduling-based optimization algorithm for the pick-and-place segregation robot. Additionally, I delved into ROS Serial and Tiva boards, experimenting and contributing to the development of a marker-based conveyor belt velocity estimation algorithm. </p>

    The scheduling algorithm integrated a Kalman Tracker with a YOLO object detector, while the velocity estimator leveraged ArUCo markers. Following the successful completion of my internship, I transitioned into a full-time role as a robotics engineer.

In my new role, a pivotal task was migrating the entire code base from ROS1 (Python) to C++ and creating a modular system architecture. This architectural shift aimed at enabling the operation of multiple robots on a single conveyor belt, unlocking new possibilities for efficiency. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Encountering limitations with ROS, I took on the challenge of disintegrating segments into independent C++ programs. To address portability concerns, I implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline. This proved invaluable when managing robots at both the company premises and deployment facilities, ensuring seamless updates and system runs. </p>

Throughout my tenure, I extensively collaborated with the Jetson ecosystem. Initial experiments and testing were conducted on Jetson Nano, with later deployments seamlessly transitioning to Jetson AGX. Noteworthy optimizations were made to the vision pipeline, transitioning from a frame-by-frame approach to a more streamlined streaming process using the Nvidia DeepStream SDK. </p>
