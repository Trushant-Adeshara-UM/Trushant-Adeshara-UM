<b>Wastefull Insights</b>, a deep-tech startup headquartered in <b>Vadodara</b>, is pioneering AI-driven solutions for effective waste segregation. The company introduced <b>"Achhe Dinn"</b>, India's first e-commerce platform promoting recycled, upcycled, and sustainable products. Focused on <b>source segregation, circular economy practices, and automating dry waste segregation</b>, Wastefull Insights is driving change across the nation. </p>

<h2>Internship Experience</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify">
My journey with Wastefull Insights began as a <b>Robotics Engineering Intern</b>, where I took on the following tasks:
</p>
* Studied the existing code base to gain a deep understanding of their systems.
* Developed a <b>scheduling-based optimization algorithm</b> for a <b>pick-and-place segregation robot</b>.
* Explored ROS Serial and Tiva boards, contributing to a marker-based conveyor belt velocity estimation algorithm.

<h3>Key Technical Contributions:</h3>
1. <b>Scheduling Algorithm</b>:
* Designed a system combining a <b>Kalman Tracker</b> with a <b>YOLO object detector</b> for optimized scheduling.

2. <b>Velocity Estimation</b>:
* Developed a solution leveraging <b>ArUCo markers</b> for conveyor belt velocity estimation.

<p style="text-align: justify">
After successfully completing my internship, I transitioned into a <b>full-time Robotics Engineer</b> role.</p>

<h2>Full-Time Role: Robotics Engineer</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify">
As a Robotics Engineer, I undertook projects that defined the next phase of my professional journey:</p>

1. <b>Code Base Migration</b>:
* Migrated the entire robotics code base from <b>ROS1 (Python)</b> to <b>C++</b>.
* Designed a <b>modular system architecture</b> enabling multiple robots to operate simultaneously on a single conveyor belt, improving efficiency and scalability.

2. <b>Independent Systems Development</b>:
* Addressed limitations in ROS by disintegrating specific modules into <b>independent C++ programs</b>.
* Developed a <b>CI/CD pipeline</b> to ensure robust system portability and seamless updates. This was crucial for maintaining the performace of robots at <b>company premise</b> and <b>deployment facilities</b>.

3. <b>Vision Pipeline Optimization</b>:
* Conducted initial experiments on <b>Jetson Nano</b> and transitioned deployments to <b>Jetson NX</b> for enhanced performance.
* Transitioned the vision pipeline from a <b>frame-by-frame approach</b> to a <b>streaming process</b> using the <b>Nvidia DeepStream SDK</b>, significantly enhancing processing efficiency.
