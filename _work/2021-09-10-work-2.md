<h2>Internship Opportunity</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">
In May 2021, I received an exciting message from <b>Nikhil Venkatesh</b>, the Director of Botsync Technologies, regarding an internship opportunity I had inquired about a year earlier. The prospect of working with such a dynamic startup was thrilling, and after a successful interview, I was offered the position.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
However, this opportunity came during the peak of the <b>Covid-19 pandemic</b>, necessitating travel from my hometown to <b>Bangalore</b>. The team at Botsync was incredibly accommodating, allowing me to begin the internship with a <b>15-day remote work period</b>, giving me time to arrange my travel and accommodation.
</p>

<h2>Industry Experience</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">
In <b>July 2021</b>, I joined Botsync’s <b>core robotics software team</b>. It was my first industry experience, and I quickly encountered the steep learning curve that comes with working in a fast-paced startup. The primary programming language used at Botsync was <b>C++</b>, and development was conducted within the <b>Robot Operating System (ROS)</b> framework.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Thanks to my prior experience with <b>eYantra</b>, I was familiar with the fundamentals of ROS, but transitioning from <b>Python to C++</b> for implementation posed a significant challenge. The supportive team environment helped me adapt quickly and grow as a developer.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Botsync’s closely interconnected departments provided a unique opportunity to not only deepen my expertise in <b>robotics software development</b> but also gain valuable insights into <b>fabrication, embedded systems, and robot assembly</b>.
</p>

<h2>Key Contributions</h2>
During my time at Botsync, I undertook two significant projects:

1. <b>Migration of Charging Station Code</b>:
* I migrated the <b>charging station code</b> from Python to C++, maintaining its functionality while ensuring the precise docking and undocking of AMRs to the charging stations.
* This project required meticulous attention to detail to achieve seamless interaction between the robots and the charging infrastructure.

2. <b>ROS and Open-RMF</b>:
* I contributed to the development of <b>ROS based Open-RMF middleware</b>, a fleet manager enabling the integration of heterogeneous robots through software adaptors.
* Designed <b>behavioral graphs</b> for multi-robot systems, facilitating the execution of <b>collision-free tasks</b> in dynamic environments.

<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">
My internship at Botsync was an immensely rewarding experience that provided me with a solid foundation in <b>C++ programming, ROS-based development</b>, and the practical challenges of robotics software engineering.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Working in a fast-paced startup also broadened my perspective on how <b>hardware, software, and team collaboration</b> converge to create innovative solutions. I'm deeply grateful to <b>Nikhil Venkatesh</b> and my colleagues for their support and guidance, which significantly contributed to my professional growth.
