<p style="text-align: justify">In 2020, my team achieved a commendable 6th position in the eYantra Robotics Competition, competing in the Survey and Rescue theme. A captivating aspect of the competition was the opportunity for winners to intern at IIT Bombay the following summer. However, due to the challenges posed by the pandemic, the finals were delayed, leading me to believe that the internship might not materialize.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">To my delight, in the first week of April, I discovered that eYSIP would be conducted remotely, allowing for the inclusion of more participants. This marked my first undergraduate internship, and although the interview was pending, the prospect of a remote internship was an exciting development. The interview date was set for April 21st, and to ensure I was well-prepared, I scheduled the furthest available slot. Reflecting on the experience, an earlier slot might have provided more project options. Nonetheless, on April 25th at 4 pm, I had my interview, a truly amazing experience where I chose to delve into the domain of web development.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Beyond the eYRC route, participants could explore other avenues such as cracking the eYantra hackathon, attending MOOCs, or being finalists in the eYIC program. I vividly remember April 12th, immersed in my research project when I decided to check my email. The news of securing my first remote internship with e-Yantra was breathtaking.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The internship officially commenced on May 8th, and my team comprised five members, including two junior mentors and one senior mentor. As an early enthusiast of web development during my undergrad days, this opportunity aligned perfectly with my interests.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Discord became our primary mode of communication, and the entire eYantra internship unfolded seamlessly on a single server. Work wasn't the only focus; we also played games and listened to music together. We adopted an iterative approach to web development, introducing new features in each iteration. Throughout the internship, we had three presentations attended by interns, mentors, and field experts, all under the guidance of Prof. Kavi Arya. Extensively using Git for version control proved crucial in overcoming the challenge of syncing features, given the remote nature of our collaboration.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">eYSIP wasn't just about work; it provided a platform for inter-group activities, allowing me to interact with individuals from diverse groups and domains. In a short span, we transformed from interns to a close-knit community, almost like a family. The program featured talks by experts such as Kalind Karia, Dr. Rathin Biswas, Admiral Anil Chopra, Dr. Ajit Ranade, Kalpit Mankikar, Dr. Parul Tank, P.V. Subramanyam, Dr. Sriram Srinivasan, Kiran Despande, Prof. Ragunath Iyer, Prof. Paritosh Pandya, and Prof. Sudha Shastri every 3-4 days.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Beyond project development, the internship imparted valuable life lessons. Finally, I had the opportunity to showcase the analytical dashboard we created in a virtual project exhibition, illustrating the statistics of various initiatives undertaken by eYantra. Checkout the following YouTube video for more details of the project.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Special thanks to my teammates Sanyam Rag and Vijay Chachadi. I look forward to meeting them in person one day. Gratitude to Deepa mam and Sachin sir, our primary mentors â€“ I hope our paths cross in the future.</p>
