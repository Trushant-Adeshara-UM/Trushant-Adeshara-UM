In 2020, my team achieved a commendable <b>6th position</b> in the eYantra Robotics Competition (eYRC), competing in the <b>Survey and Rescue theme</b>. One of the most exciting aspects of the competition was the opportunity for winners to intern at IIT Bombay the following summer. However, the finals were delayed due to the pandemic, and I began to think the internship might not materialize.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
To my delight, in the first week of April, I discovered that the <b>eYantra Summer Internship Program (eYSIP)</b> would be conducted remotely, allowing for the inclusion of more participants. This was my <b>first undergraduate internship</b>, and although the interview was still pending, the prospect of a remote internship was incredibly exciting. The interview date was set for April 21st, and I chose the latest slot to prepare thoroughly. Reflecting on it, selecting an earlier slot might have provided more project options. Regardless, on April 25th at 4 PM, I had an amazing interview experience and chose to delve into <b>web development</b>.

Beyond the eYRC route, participants could also join eYSIP through the <b>eYantra Hackathon</b>, MOOCs, or as finalists in the eYantra Innovation Challenge (eYIC). On April 12th, while immersed in my research project, I checked my email and discovered the incredible news: I had secured my <b>first remote internship</b> with eYantra.

The internship officially began on May 8th, with a team of five members, including two junior mentors and one senior mentor. As someone who had been enthusiastic about web development since my undergraduate days, this opportunity was a perfect fit.

<h2>Internship Highlights</h2>
* <b>Collaborative Environment</b>: We used <b>Discord</b> for all communication and coordination, making it the central hub for both work and fun. From collaborative coding sessions to playing games and listening to music, the experience was incredibly enriching.
* <b>Iterative Development</b>: Following an iterative approach, we added new features in each development cycle, refining our project at every stage.
* <b>Presentation and Feedback</b>: We had <b>three formal presentations</b> attended by interns, mentors, and field experts, all under the guidance of <b>Prof. Kavi Arya</b>. These sessions provided valuable feedback and helped us stay on track.
* <b>Version Control</b>: We extensively used <b>Git</b> to manage code and features, which was crucial for overcoming challenges in synchronizing tasks in a remote setup.

<h2>Beyond Work</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">
eYSIP wasn't solely about development; it fostered a vibrant community of interns. Inter-group activities allowed us to connect with individuals from diverse backgrounds and domains, creating a family-like bond. The program also featured <b>talks by esteemed experts</b>, including:
</p>
* Kalind Karia
* Dr. Rathin Biswas
* Admiral Anil Chopra
* Dr. Ajit Ranade
* Kalpit Mankikar
* Dr. Parul Tank
* P.V. Subramanyam
* Dr. Sriram Srinivasan
* Kiran Deshpande
* Prof. Ragunath Iyer
* Prof. Paritosh Pandya
* Prof. Sudha Shastri
<p style="text-align: justify">
These talks, held every 3-4 days, provided insights into various fields and life skills.</p>

<h2>Key Achievements</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">
At the internship's conclusion, I presented the <b>analytical dashboard</b> our team developed. This dashboard illustrated the statistics of various eYantra initiatives and was showcased in a <b>virtual project exhibition</b>. The project was a testament to teamwork, technical skill, and effective communication.

<h2>Gratitude and Reflections</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Special thanks to my teammates <b>Sanyam Rag</b> and <b>Vijay Chachadi</b> — I hope to meet them in person someday. I’m also deeply grateful to <b>Deepa Mam</b> and <b>Sachin Sir</b>, our mentors, for their invaluable guidance throughout the internship.
